  <h1 class= "actionHeader">Ready to Invest? Here are some steps you can take:</h1>

  <p class= "actionPara1"> - Research stocks📊: follow companies you're interested in or funds that have particularly good returns. Investing gets more fun if you are interested in what you're putting your money in. </p><br>

  <p class= "actionPara2"> - Save some money💵 to invest: one typically needs -- or more to start investing. Also be aware that you probably won't be able to/ or shouldn't take out your money for at least 5 years. You shouldn't invest money you'll need to pay your rent or buy groceries with. 💸 </p><br>

  <p class= "actionPara3"> - If you are not ready to start investing yet you can always practice by pretending you have $10,000 to invest in whatever you want. Practice investing that money in different companies and funds and see what your return📉 is in 3 months, 6 months or a year. </p>
