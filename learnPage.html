    <h1> Introduction to the Stock Market</h1>
    <p> The stock market is where people buy and sell investments, which are most commonly in the form of stocks, which are shares of ownership of a public company. <br><br>
    You don't have to officially be an "investor" to participate in the stock market, it's open to mostly anyone. Just like when a person wants clothes, they go to a clothing store, when a person wants to buy stocks, they go to the stock market, which is accessible to anyone with a brokerage account, robo-advisor, or employee retirement plan. People buy stocks in attempt to build long term wealth. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h1> What is the stock market? </h1>
    <p> It's difficult to track every stock on the stock market, so the term "stock market" often reffers to one of the major stock market indexes (e.g. S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average), which are indexes that include a section if the stock market, and are viewed as representative of the entire market. <br><br>
    When you hear that the stock market has moved lower, or closed up or down for the day, this usually means that the stocks within an index have either gained or lost value as a whole. The goal of investors is to make profit through this movement in stock prices. </p>
    <br><br>
    <h1> How does the stock market work? </h1>
    <p> Like an auction house, the stock market is a platform on which buyers and sellers negotiate prices and make trades. 
    <br><br>
    The stock market functions through a system of exchanges (e.g. the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq). Companies offer shares of a their company in these exchanges, and these initial offers are called Initial Public Offers (IPO). Investors purchase these shares, allowing companies to accumelate oney and expand their buisness, and investors than buy and sell these shares amongst themselves. Through this process of companies listing IPOs, investors buying, than buying and selling, the exchange moniters the supply and demand of each stock. 
    <br><br>
    This tracking of supply and demand helps determine the level at which investors and traders are willing to buy and sell stocks. These determined levels of purchase are also known as the price for each security. <br><br>
    Buyers offer a bid, which are usually lower than the price that a seller asks of in exchange of the stock. This difference is called the bid-ask spread. For a trade to occur, either the buyer must raise their bid, or the seller must lower their asking price. 
    <br><br>
    Historicaly, stock trades occured in the physical market place, but today, in our electronically dominated world, the stock market works through the internet and online stock brokers. While each trade occurs upon a stock by stock basis, the prices of these stocks tend to rise and lower in unison because of news, political events, economic reports, and other factors. </p>
  <br><br>
  <h1> What about the risk factor? </h1>
  <p> It is true that investing in the stock market is not free of risk, but with strategy, it can be done safely, with minimal chance of long-term loss. <br><br>
  The practice in which a person rapidly buys and sells stocks base on price swing- day trading- is significantly risky, but investing in the stock market for the long run, on the other hand, has been proven to be an effective way of building wealth over time. <br><br>
  Stock market volatility reffers to the periods when stock value rises and falls unexpectedly. Due to market volatility, some years the stock market enss way up, and others end way down. Despite votality, if you are investing in the stock market long-term, you have a good chance of accumulating wealth. For example, the S&P 500 has a historical average annualized return of about 10% (before adjusting for inflation), though it is rare that this amount will be returned on a yearly basis. The key to accumulating wealth is staying invested in the stock market for the long run </p>
